# vlinder-branding fonts

In the context of the vlinderapp project, two main fonts were selected to serve as:

1) A title/header font
2) A plain text font

The goal for the title font naturally is a futuristic look that matches the general design concept of the logo. While the title font hence is quite
eye-catchy, it lacks in easy accessibility in bigger blocks of texts. The second font aims to solve this issue. Currently, vlinderapp uses the
following fonts:

**Text font**: [Assistant](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Assistant)
